Deep Learning-based MRS Reconstruction and Denoising with Artificial Fourier Transform Network (AFT-Net) \
*Yanting Yang, M.S., Columbia University*

A complex-valued deep learning framework - artificial Fourier transform network (AFT-Net), which directly processes the complex-value raw data in the sensor domain, is proposed to reconstruct spectra from FIDs and denoise the spectra in parallel. We trained the model on the simulated MEGA-PRESS dataset and the in-vivo Big GABA dataset. An evaluation of different acceleration rates was performed on the in-vivo dataset. AFT-Net demonstrated the ability to reconstruct the data with high fidelity and significantly accelerate acquisition. The proposed AFT-Net is an efficient and accurate approach for MRS spectra reconstruction from raw data. \
